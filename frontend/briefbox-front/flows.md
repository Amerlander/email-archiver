## Asana Flow
1. After registration send mail with link to confirm email and a 6 digit code
2. On the website you can either enter the code or click the link
3. After confirming the mail user will be forwarded to account_setup page, where he can enter his full name and password, and also upload a picture
4. Then redirect user to dashboard

### User Registration

1. **User Accesses Registration Page**: Direct the user to the registration form.
2. **User Input Validation**: Check for valid and complete information.
3. **Existing User Check**: If the user exists, redirect to the login page or show a message.
4. **Create User and Hash Password**: Store the new user's hashed password in the database.
5. **Send Confirmation Email (Optional)**: If email verification is required, send a confirmation email and direct the user to a "check your email" page.
6. **Redirect to Login**: Post-registration, redirect the user to the login page with a success message.

### User Login

1. **User Accesses Login Page**: Present the login form.
2. **Input Validation and User Authentication**: Validate inputs and authenticate the user.
3. **Failed Login**: If authentication fails, show an error and remain on the login page.
4. **Successful Login**: On success, generate a JWT token and redirect the user to their dashboard or homepage.

### Authentication Middleware

1. **Token Verification**: For each protected route, check the JWT token.
2. **Unauthorized Access**: If the user is not authenticated or the token is invalid, redirect to the login page.
3. **Authorized Access**: Allow access to the requested resource.

### Password Reset Flow

1. **User Requests Password Reset**: Direct them to a password reset request page.
2. **Email Verification**: After submitting their email, show a confirmation message and instruct them to check their email.
3. **Password Reset Email**: The email contains a link to a password reset page.
4. **Reset Password**: The user enters a new password and submits it.
5. **Verify Token and Update Password**: Validate the token and update the password.
6. **Redirect to Login**: After a successful password reset, redirect the user to the login page with a success message.

### Additional User Flows

- **Email Verification**: After registration, if email verification is required, restrict access to certain features until the email is verified. Provide a resend email verification option.
- **User Logout**: On logout, invalidate the user's session or token and redirect to the login page.
- **Session Timeout**: If the session expires, prompt the user to log in again.

### Security and UX Considerations

- **Clear Messaging**: Provide clear messages for each action (e.g., "Registration successful", "Invalid credentials", "Check your email for the reset link").
- **Smooth Redirections**: Ensure that transitions between different states (like logging in, logging out, password reset) are smooth and clear to the user.
- **Consistent Layout**: Maintain a consistent layout across different authentication pages for a cohesive user experience.
- **Feedback on User Actions**: Provide immediate and clear feedback for user actions (e.g., form submission, clicking a reset link).

### Testing Considerations

- **Flow Testing**: Test the complete flow from the user's perspective for registration, login, password reset, etc.
- **User Feedback Loop**: Consider user feedback for improving the flow and UX/UI design.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the authentication pages are responsive across devices.

Creating an application like "Timeliner" requires careful consideration of UI/UX to ensure that it is user-friendly, intuitive, and visually appealing. Here's a proposed approach for the UI/UX design after user login:

### Dashboard Overview
- **Landing Page**: After login, direct users to a dashboard that provides an overview of their current projects.
- **Quick Access Panel**: Include shortcuts for creating new projects, workstreams, milestones, tasks, and dependencies.
- **Notification Area**: Display alerts for upcoming deadlines, completed tasks, or other important updates.

### Projects Management
- **Projects List**: Show all projects in an organized list or grid view, with options to sort by date, priority, or status.
- **Individual Project View**: Clicking on a project should open a detailed view with all related workstreams, milestones, tasks, and dependencies.
- **Create/Edit Project**: Provide a simple form to create or edit project details like name, description, start/end dates.

### Workstreams within Projects
- **Workstream Overview**: Within each project, display different workstreams as separate sections or tabs.
- **Visual Representation**: Use colors or icons to differentiate workstreams for quick recognition.

### Milestones and Tasks
- **Timeline View**: Present milestones and tasks on a visual timeline for each workstream. This could be a horizontal timeline with draggable elements.
