ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

This project is currently still in early development and lacks proper authentication and security measures. It is NOT recommended to expose this application to the public as you are basically providing the world your emails. Use at your own discretion and only in a controlled environment for now.

# Briefbox

Briefbox is a powerful tool for archiving emails from multiple IMAP and POP3 accounts. It provides a user-friendly web interface for managing email accounts, searching archived emails, and viewing email details along with attachments. One of the standout features of Briefbox is its advanced search functionality, which allows users to quickly find specific emails using various criteria.

## Features

- Add, update, and delete IMAP and POP3 email accounts
- Automatically fetch and archive emails from configured accounts
- **Powerful search functionality:**
  - Search archived emails based on subject, sender, recipients, or body content
  - Perform case-insensitive searches for more accurate results
  - Search for emails by date using flexible date formats (e.g., "26 Jan 2024", "2024-01-26", "January 26, 2024")
  - **Search for emails within a specific date range using the format "DD MMM YYYY - DD MMM YYYY" (e.g., "26 Jan 2024 - 28 Jan 2024")**
  - Use multiple search terms to narrow down results
  - Examples:
    - Search for emails from a specific sender: `john@example.com`
    - Find emails with a specific subject: `"Project Update"`
    - Search for emails containing certain keywords in the body: `meeting agenda`
    - Combine multiple criteria: `from:john@example.com subject:"Project Update" meeting`
    - Search for emails by date: `26 Jan 2024`, `2024-01-26`, `January 26, 2024`
    - **Search for emails within a date range: `26 Jan 2024 - 28 Jan 2024`**
- View email details, including subject, sender, recipients, date, and body
- Download email attachments
- Periodic email archiving to keep the database up to date

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

Here's the updated Setup and Usage section for your README:

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bandundu/email-archiver.git
cd email-archiver
```

2. Generate the Fernet key and populate the `.env` file:

```bash
make generate-key
```

3. Pull the pre-built Docker image from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker-compose pull
```

4. Run the Docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

5. Access the web interface by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.

6. Use the web interface to add email accounts, search for emails, and view email details.

**Note:** If you want to build the Docker image locally instead of pulling the pre-built image from Docker Hub, you can run the following command before step 4:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

This will build the Docker image locally using the provided Dockerfile.

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system before running the above commands.

To stop the running containers and clean up the environment, you can use the following command:

```bash
make clean
```

This command will stop and remove the Docker containers, as well as delete the `.env` file.

Remember to update the `.env` file with your own configuration settings, such as the `SECRET_KEY`, if needed.


5. Access the web interface by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.

6. Use the web interface to add email accounts, search for emails, and view email details.

## Configuration

The project uses a SQLite database to store the archived emails and account information. The database file is located at `email_archive.db` in the project directory.

To configure the email archiving settings, you can modify the `email_archiver.py` file, which contains the main logic for fetching and archiving emails from the configured accounts.

## Reusing an Existing Database

If you want to reuse an existing database with a previously generated Fernet key, follow these steps:

1. Copy your existing `email_archive.db` file into the project directory.

2. Copy the `SECRET_KEY` value from your existing `.env` file.

3. Run `make generate-key` to generate a new `.env` file.

4. Replace the `SECRET_KEY` value in the newly generated `.env` file with the value you copied from your existing `.env` file.

5. Run `make build` and `make run` to start the project with your existing database.

## Known Bugs and Issues

- UTF encoding in sender
- No ARM support

## Future Enhancements

- Email export functionality
- Gmail and Outlook OAuth2 authentication
- Advanced search capabilities (e.g., date range, multiple criteria)
- Improved user interface and user experience
